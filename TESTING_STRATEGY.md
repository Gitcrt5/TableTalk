# TableTalk Bridge Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the TableTalk Bridge Analysis Platform, implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices across all layers of the application.

## Testing Philosophy
- **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **Bridge-Specific Validation**: Specialized tests for bridge game logic
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on every commit
- **Performance Monitoring**: Load and performance testing for critical paths

## Testing Stack
- **Primary Test Runner**: Vitest (fast, Vite-integrated)
- **Frontend Testing**: React Testing Library + Testing Library Jest DOM
- **API Mocking**: MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright
- **Database Testing**: Separate test database with fixtures
- **Coverage**: c8 coverage reporting
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions integration

---

---

## Phase 6: End-to-End Testing

### ✅ Tasks

### E2E User Journeys
1. **New User Journey**: Register → Create profile → Join game → Analyze board
2. **Tournament Director**: Create event → Upload PBN → Manage participants
3. **Player Analysis**: View board → Enter bids → Add comments → Share insights
4. **Mobile Experience**: All workflows tested on mobile devices

---

## Phase 7: Performance & Load Testing

### ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Test API response times under load
- [ ] Test frontend rendering performance
- [ ] Test database query optimization
- [ ] Test file upload handling with large files
- [ ] Test concurrent user scenarios
- [ ] Test memory usage and leaks
- [ ] Test caching effectiveness

---

## Test Data Management

### ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Create test fixtures for users, games, and boards
- [ ] Set up database seeding for consistent test scenarios
- [ ] Create mock PBN files for testing
- [ ] Implement test data cleanup procedures
- [ ] Create realistic bridge deal datasets
- [ ] Set up user persona test data

### Test Data Categories
- **Users**: Various skill levels, preferences, tournament history
- **Games**: Casual, tournament, different formats
- **Boards**: Standard deals, unusual distributions, teaching hands
- **PBN Files**: Valid files, corrupted files, edge cases

---

## Continuous Integration Setup

### ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Set up automated test execution on PR
- [ ] Configure coverage reporting and thresholds
- [ ] Set up database migrations for CI
- [ ] Configure environment variables for CI
- [ ] Set up notification for test failures

### CI Pipeline Stages
1. **Lint & Type Check**: Code quality validation
2. **Unit Tests**: Fast feedback on individual components
3. **Integration Tests**: API and database validation
4. **E2E Tests**: Critical user journey validation
